        <h1>The best way to give</h1>
        <p>We've all experienced it - somebody stops you on the street or calls your home to try to get support for their organization, but you don't have the time. You don't want to be locked down with monthly payments. You don't want to fill out paperwork. You want to give, but not like that. <span class="haiduk">Haiduk</span> solves that problem. You give as much as you want, whenever you want, all in the click of a button.</p>

            <h2>1. It's easy to use our service</h2>
            <p>Not to say that the current method of collecting donations is broken, we just think that it could use some work. We believe that the charity world is not taking full advantage of the direction modern transactions are moving and we try to fix that. Every charity in one place, ultra direct donation system, and no hassle donations: that is our mission.</p>

            <h2>3. We are a new way to donate</h2>
            <p>These days you have to fill out long web forms or take advantage of snail mail to donate to charities. We think that leaves them at a disadvantage - everybody is busy and sometimes can't spare the time to go through this process. When is the last time you helped the world at the click of a button?</p>
